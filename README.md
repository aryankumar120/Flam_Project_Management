# 🌟 Proposal for Onboarding Feature Enhancement in Flam AR

## 🎯 Objective

To enhance Flam’s **first-time user experience** through an **interactive mission-based onboarding flow** that increases engagement, reduces drop-offs, and sets up users for creative success.

---

## 🔍 Problem Framing

**Current Challenge:**

Flam’s onboarding is visually appealing but lacks guided interactivity. First-time users may feel **overwhelmed**, **underutilize** the AR capabilities, or **exit before discovering core value**.

> AR is magical — but only if users know what to do first.
> 

**Observed Gaps:**

- No step-by-step AR discovery.
- Lack of early user gratification.
- Low motivation to explore features deeply.
- Passive onboarding ≠ Active creativity.

## 💡 Proposed Solution: **Mission-Based Gamified Onboarding**

Introduce a **3-step mission-based onboarding journey** that guides new users with micro-goals, rewards, and creative actions.

## 🧭 User Flow Overview

1. **Welcome Screen**
    - Goal: Set tone and excite
    - Feature: Option to "Skip & Explore" or "Begin Mission"
2. **Mission 1: Place Your First 3D Object**
    - Reward: Completion badge
3. **Mission 2: Customize It**
    - Filters, stickers, animations
    - Reward: XP or unlock visual effects
4. **Mission 3: Share Your World**
    - Upload or view your creation in AR feed
    - Reward: Confetti + public highlight option

> ✅ After completion: User enters the full Flam app with a sense of achievement, clarity, and motivation.

## 🧠 Why This Works ?

| Core Principle | Implementation in Proposal |
| --- | --- |
| **Product Thinking** | Introduces value through active doing, not telling |
| **User-Centric Design** | Designed around common AR first-timer confusion |
| **Retention-Oriented** | Motivational psychology via gamified progression |
| **Creativity-First** | Onboarding doesn’t teach *about* AR — it *uses* AR |

## 📈 Success Metrics (Post-Implementation Goals)

- ⏳ **+20% time spent during first session**
- 🚀 **+40% increase in first creation shared**
